I'll walk you through setting up SSH keys for GitHub access:

1. Generate an SSH key pair

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


(Use the email associated with your GitHub account)

When prompted for a file location, press Enter to accept the default. When asked for a passphrase, you can enter one for extra security or press Enter twice to skip.

2. Add your public key to GitHub

First, copy your public key:

On macOS:

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


On Windows (Git Bash):

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip


On Linux:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Then copy the output manually.

Now add it to GitHub:

Go to GitHub.com and sign in

Click your profile photo â†’ Settings

In the sidebar, click "SSH and GPG keys"

Click "New SSH key"

Add a descriptive title (e.g., "Work Laptop")

Paste your key in the "Key" field

Click "Add SSH key"

3. Configure your repository to use SSH

If you're setting up a new repository:

git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git


If you already have a repository using HTTPS, change the remote URL:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git


4. Test your connection

ssh -T git@github.com


You should see a message like: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

Now you can pull and push to your GitHub repository without entering a password or token each time!
